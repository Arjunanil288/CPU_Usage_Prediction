 # CPU Usage Prediction Using Linear Regression
# Description:
This project involves analyzing the comp-activ database, which captures activity measures of computer systems, to establish a linear equation for predicting 'usr' (the percentage of time CPUs operate in user mode). The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 in a multi-user university department, where users engaged in diverse tasks such as internet access, file editing, and running CPU-intensive programs.
# Features: 
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Linear Regression model development
Evaluation of model performance
# Technology stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
# Results: 
The linear regression model developed in this project provides a clear understanding of the factors influencing CPU usage in user mode. Key insights include the significant impact of memory usage and disk activity on CPU performance.
# Future improvements:
Future work could involve exploring more advanced machine learning models, incorporating additional system attributes, and applying cross-validation techniques to improve model robustness.
